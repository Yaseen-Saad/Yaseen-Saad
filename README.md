# Lists

```
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

1. Make my changes
    1. Fix bug
    2. Improve formatting
        - Make the headings bigger
2. Push my commits to GitHub
3. Open a pull request
    * Describe my changes
    * Mention all the members of my team
        * Ask for feedback

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

The world, a cacophony of sights and sounds, a relentless demand for attention. It was within this constant barrage that I discovered a peculiar sanctuary – a quiet revolution within. I call them "blackouts," moments when the vibrant hues of the world seem to fade, the symphony of sounds muted, and the familiar sensations of my body – the warmth of the sun, the touch of the ground – recede. It was as if I was watching a movie, a detached observer in my own life.
Initially, these episodes were terrifying, a jarring disconnect from reality. The world seemed to judge – a constant drumbeat about the importance of focus, of being present. I worried I was losing control, slipping into madness. Yet, amidst the fear, a strange curiosity began to stir. What was happening to me? Why did the world suddenly feel so distant?
Slowly, I began to decipher the patterns. These blackouts, I realized, were not random occurrences. They were triggered by overwhelming stimuli, by the incessant chatter of my own mind. They were a defense mechanism, a way for my brain to escape the noise and find a fleeting moment of tranquility.
And then, came the turning point. I discovered that I could, to a degree, control these episodes. By focusing on a specific sound, like the rhythmic ticking of a clock or the hum of the air conditioner, I could induce a state of detachment, a quietude that allowed my mind to wander, to explore uncharted territories. During these moments, time seemed to slow down. Thoughts flowed freely, unhindered by the usual distractions. Problems that had seemed insurmountable suddenly presented themselves with elegant solutions.
This newfound understanding transformed my approach to learning. During exams, the cacophony of anxious thoughts could be overwhelming. But I learned to harness the power of dissociation, to induce a brief blackout, silencing the internal noise and allowing me to focus solely on the questions at hand. It was as if I was accessing a deeper level of concentration, a state of pure, unadulterated thought.
These experiences have led me to question the very nature of consciousness. What does it mean to be present? Is constant engagement with the external world truly the most fulfilling state of being? Perhaps, I've come to believe, there is value in detachment, in stepping back from the relentless demands of the external world to explore the inner landscape of the mind.
My journey with dissociation has been an ongoing exploration. It has taught me the importance of self-awareness, of understanding the unique workings of my own mind. It has shown me that even in the most unexpected challenges, there can be hidden opportunities for growth and transformation.
Hook: The world may demand constant engagement, but within the quietude of my own mind, I discovered a revolution – a unique form of consciousness that allows me to navigate the complexities of the world with a newfound clarity and perspective.




Initially, these episodes were terrifying, a jarring disconnect from reality. The pressure to excel, to escape the constraints of my socioeconomic background, weighed heavily upon me. The world seemed to judge – a constant drumbeat about the importance of focus, of being present. I worried I was losing control, slipping into madness. Yet, amidst the fear, a strange curiosity began to stir. What was happening to me? Why did the world suddenly feel so distant?
Slowly, I began to decipher the patterns. These blackouts, I realized, were not random occurrences. They were triggered by overwhelming stimuli, by the incessant chatter of my own mind, a reflection of the pressure I felt to succeed. They were a defense mechanism, a way for my brain to escape the noise and find a fleeting moment of tranquility.
And then, came the turning point. I discovered that I could, to a degree, control these episodes. By focusing on a specific sound, like the rhythmic chanting of the muezzin or the gentle lapping of the Nile against the shore, I could induce a state of detachment, a quietude that allowed my mind to wander, to explore uncharted territories. During these moments, time seemed to slow down. Problems that had seemed insurmountable suddenly presented themselves with elegant solutions.

The universe, a vast expanse of mysteries, a constant interplay of forces. As a young boy, I was captivated by the intricate dance of planets, the enigmatic nature of consciousness. I spent hours pondering the cosmos, the infinitesimally small, and the infinitely large, often losing myself in a whirlwind of thoughts. But there was another kind of "loss," a more profound detachment, that I began to experience – a momentary escape into a realm of pure thought. I call them "blackouts," moments when the vibrant hues of the world seem to fade, the symphony of sounds muted, and the familiar sensations of my body – the warmth of the sun, the touch of the ground – recede. It was as if I was watching a movie, a detached observer in my own life.

During these moments, time seemed to slow down. Thoughts flowed freely, unhindered by the usual distractions. Complex physics equations seemed to resolve themselves, philosophical dilemmas unraveling with elegant simplicity.
